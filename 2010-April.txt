Hello

I have spent a long time trying to figure out why the function
RaiseLgth() was giving an error. It seems that the field catchCat in
HL,SL and CA should be "Lan" or "Dis" while the field catReg in HH
should be "LAN" or "DIS" (all capitals) this is not how it is specified
in the data exchange format in the final report and it also seems to be
different from previous versions of costDBE.

 

Is there any way that the csData() function can be fixed so it accepts
both formats (uppercase and lowercase) and only produces the 'correct'
format (as above)?

Hi Hans,

The function that check the codes is "check.fields". You may check with 
showMethods("csData", includeDefs=TRUE). This function uses a code list 
called code.list . You may check with head(check.fields) . If you look 
at the code.list for catchCat they are "LAN" and "DIS".

 > data(code.list)
 > code.list$catchCat
code description
1 DIS Discard
2 LAN Landing

So a number of things can be happening. There may be a bug but also your 
object may not be properly built. Can you please send a replicable 
example of the problem !?

Hi ernesto, hopefully the attached example works for you

catReg is allowed to be 'LAN' according to the code list but my example
only works if catReg is 'Lan'

Thanks
Hans

Hi,

The problem is not with catchCat. As the code list shows, it should be 
"LAN" or "DIS"

 > library(COSTdbe)
Loading required package: COSTcore
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 COSTcore - "The DCF Statistical Suite"
 (Version: 1.3-8. Built on: R 2.11.0; ; 2010-04-23 14:06:37 UTC; unix)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading required package: lattice
Loading required package: boot

Attaching package: 'boot'

The following object(s) are masked from 'package:lattice':

    melanoma

Loading required package: tcltk
Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... done
 > data(code.list)
 > code.list$catchCat
  code description
1  DIS     Discard
2  LAN     Landing

The problem is with catReg that is accepted to be "LAN" or "Lan" (or others)

 > code.list$catReg
  code                              description
1  All                   Whole catch registered
2  Lan Only landed fraction of catch registered
3  Dis       Only discarded fraction registered
4  Non             None of the catch registered
5  ALL                   Whole catch registered
6  LAN Only landed fraction of catch registered
7  DIS       Only discarded fraction registered
8  NON             None of the catch registered


However, the RaiseLgth method, which calls a function "Raise_Lgth", uses 
another method called "sampledFO" that requires catReg to be "Lan". When 
you change codReg to "LAN" this method gives a empty result that later 
breaks RaiseLgth.

if you look at sampledFO with showMethods("sampledFO", includeDefs=TRUE)

You may check that the fifth line is

else frac <- "Lan"

and this is the problem. When you change catReg from "Lan" to "LAN" this 
method fails and everything else too.

Conclusion, there's nothing wrong with your data and using "Lan" for 
catReg is ok, using "LAN" to catchCat is also ok. The bug is on 
sampledFO, that should use "Lan" or "LAN".

I'll let the bug fixing for the package maintainer ;-)

Hope it helped

Ernesto,

You would have had a brilliant carreer as a detective!
With this only email I learn a lot on how to look at a method.
thanks for this.

I'm sure Mathieu will arrange this very quickly with adding "toupper" 
before using the variable.
With the outcome of the recent WKCOST, new releases of the different 
libraries will have to be uploaded on the website. When? is the 
principal question...

best regards

Joel

Dear COST users,

a new release of packages COSTcore, COSTdbe and COSTeda has been  
updated on the website.
These releases fix some bugs seen during and after the WKCOST such as  
doing the same actions independently of the use of capital letters in  
catchCat ("LAN" or "Lan", "DIS" or "Dis") and also some bug in  
RaiseLgth where certain conditions where providing a wrong response  
(samples weighted but not measured).

The releases have the same versioning
COSTcore_1.3-8.zip
COSTdbe_1.3-6.zip
COSTeda_1.3-6.zip

Please make sure to replace your versions by these ones.

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel, 

I tried to download the new libraries from the website but it has a
"IFREMER secure access system" that asked me for a username and a
password. Is it necessary to have this password to download the packages
from the website?.

Best,

Hi Paz,

no that was an old bug that I thought was fixed. I look at this now, try 
within 15 minutes, otherwise go directly on the BERLIOS website.

Now the COST website is back to normal

I think we should add in the COST 2.0 proposal the setting of a
