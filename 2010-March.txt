Subject: [cost-users] Dear COST list,

Dear COST list,
we are tenaciously working with COST and here another question we hope you could help use to solve.

We have unexpected different results when we raise n-at-length discards (from sea sampling data) by landing. on the contrary, all the other raising methods provide consistent results.

Raising for the weight of discards by landing is ok, too. Thus, we expect that landing data are ok (they work for weight estimates), and length data are ok too (they work for the oether raising methods), but for some reason they do not work together.

A second brief question: why the RaiseLgth method does not work with discards? Is it related to our data, or there some technical issue behind the method? Of course, I'm aware that totVolume(..., type="n-at-length") could do the same

In attachment (sorry for posting stuff) we provide script and workspace with consolidated objects and stratification, that hopefully could help for understanding our issue.


Thanks in advance for your time

Sofia and Valerio

Hi Sofia,

I can't not find the problem. If no one replies on the next few hours I 
suggest you email the maintainer David Maxwell <david.maxwell at cefas.co.uk>.

Hi,
We appreciate all your efforts to use and test the COST software. No need to email me separately as I'm on this list. I'm away at a meeting but may have chance to look at your data next week if Mathieu (who wrote the code) has not looked at before then.

To everyone using the COST code what I suggest will be very useful is to create a list of bugs, issues & required enhancements. These lists could be combined and discussed at WKCOST.
Regards, David
