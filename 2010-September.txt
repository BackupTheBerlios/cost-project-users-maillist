Subject: [cost-users] Subsetting in COST
Message-ID: <4C9A252B02000092000044B0@mail.fiskeriverket.se>

Dear COST list
 
I have some problems with subsetting CS objects, using the general
function subset. I?m preparing data for the upcoming workshop WKEID
where we intend to use COST to look at discard data from several
countries and years. When I try to subset on year using the general
subset function I lose some records. 
 
My example:
I want to subset the CS object swe.cs which contains several years
data:
(looking at the SL table here)
 
> table(swe.cs at sl$year)
 
2002 2003 2004 2006 2007 2008 2009 
 705  282  486  542  218  325  460 
 
> swe.2009 <-  subset(swe.cs, year==2009)
 
> table(swe.2009 at sl$year)
 
2009 
 352 
So there should be 460 records from 2009 in the sl table. If I specify
a table "above" the SL, I also get different results depending on which
one I choose. Maybe I?m doing something wrong here, has anyone else
experienced similar problems?
 
Any advice on this would be most welcome! (If someone would like to
take a closer look I will be happy to send the data.)
 
Best regards

Hi Sofia,

I'm a bit "out of the blue" as I can't replicate the problem with the 
sole dataset distributed by COSTcore.

The workhorse is a function called subsetCOST which is not exported. You 
can get it though with COSTcore:::subsetCOST .

One way to look at the problem you have is to start debugging this 
function and run subset again. Try

debug(COSTcore:::subsetCOST)
subset(swe.cs, year==2009)

you'll be dumped in the function's environment, where your data will be 
object "x". All the code will run line by line and you can inspect if 
something went wrong.

Have fun :-)

and send me the data so I can take a quick look.

Best

EJ

Thank you, I also got a reply from Mathieu and it turns out that I did not have the latest version of COSTcore. I installed that and it seems to work now.
 
Thanks again everyone for answering so quickly!
 
Best regards
Sofia
