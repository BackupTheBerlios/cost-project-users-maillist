Subject: [cost-users] COST and SOP

Hi all

we are working the French data in an internal WS in Ifremer with COST,  
and the SOP discrepancy has not been dealt with in the project.  
Indeed, the weight at length and @age are estimated independently from  
the N at length and N at age, so we see that it often leads to SOP  
discrepancies.

My question is, did you also face this problem and of course, did you  
write some code to deal with this. IMO, there are easy solutions  
(translation on w at length) that  would prefer avoiding, and more  
complex/proper solution (do you know some papers on this issue?),  
that's why I would like your comments on this.

Thanks in advance

Joel
