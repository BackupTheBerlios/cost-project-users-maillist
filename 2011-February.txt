Hi

 

 When I try to recode e.g. fishingactivities in COST (running in R 2.10.1) I get the following error message,

 

Warning message:

In `levels<-`(`*tmp*`, value = c("OTB_DEF_90-119_0_0", "OTB_DEF_90-119_0_0" :

  duplicated levels will not be allowed in factors anymore

 

 I don't get the error message when running COST in R 2.8.1. 

 

 It looks like the result a least from totVolume are the same in both R-versions, so is it safe to ignore the error message?

 

 I have attached the workspaces from both R 2.8.1 and 2.10.1.

 

 Overall I'm a bit confused about all the R-versions, which one will you recommend for COST?

 

Kind regards Kirsten

Hi Kristen,

You may use whatever version you prefer, COST runs on both, as far as I 
remember. You must be aware of the COST version you're using, always use 
the latest stable release.

Regarding this error, it results from R development. In version 2.10.1 
they don't allow duplicated levels for factors. As a matter of fact they 
should have never allowed it ... check R news 
(http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/NEWS)

"factor(), levels()<-, etc, now ensure that the resulting factor levels are unique (as was always the implied intention). Factors with duplicated levels are still constructible by low-level means, but are now declared illegal."


You may check the levels of your factor in both versions. I suppose you 
have to use "levels(fishingactivities)" and check that they are the 
same. Also check with "as.numeric(levels(fishingactivities))" to make 
sure the internal factor coding is correct.

Best

ps: next time don't send the R session, send the data and a small script 
that people can run and replicate the error.

Hi Ernesto

 

 Thanks for your answer. I have checked the levels with string you send and it looks ok in the consolidated data.

 

Kind regards Kirsten
