<PRE>Hi Kirsten,

 

Unless the code has changed recently then I think this is not possible and that was a decision made on purpose. Joel will be able to confirm this.

 

If samples are lent then the total number of samples will appear to be higher than the actual number of samples collected and the precision will be artificially improved. Therefore, the options available are to combine the quarters or not produce results in the quarter with no samples.

 

Regards, David

Subject: [cost-users] Lending samples in COST

 

Hi 

 

Is it possible to lend e.g. samples from one quarter to another in COST, without putting them together as one. 

 

Example; 

 

 We have sampled GNS_DEF for discard in 1st, 2nd and 4th quarter and I would like to use the samples from the 4th on the landings in the 3rd quarter, but I would still like the final results per quarter.

 

I can't seem to find any method in the manual, but I have overlooked it.

 

Kind regards 

Kirsten Birch H&#229;kansson
